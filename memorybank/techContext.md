- Streamlit for frontend UI and interaction
- OpenAI API for text generation and validation
- Pinecone for vector database and document retrieval
- LangSmith for tracing and observability

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (with custom CSS for RTL Hebrew)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI (GPT-4o)
- **Observability**: LangSmith
- **External Libraries**: 
  - nest_asyncio (for async execution in Streamlit)
  - python-dotenv (for environment configuration)

## Rules Compliance Assessment
- **Analyzed on**: 2025-05-06
- **Files Evaluated**: 19 Python files across application modules
- **Key Strengths**:
  - Good module organization and code structure
  - Effective error handling in critical paths
  - Proper security practices for API keys
  - Thoughtful separation of concerns across components
  - Clean implementation of async patterns for validation

- **Critical Issues**:
  - Dynamic imports using `sys.path.insert` and `importlib.util` in retriever.py and utils/__init__.py
  - Global state management for service clients
  - Runtime modification of configuration values

- **Medium Issues**:
  - Mixing synchronous calls from asynchronous contexts (blocking the event loop)
  - Missing LangSmith tags and metadata for proper tracing
  - Insufficient input sanitization for traced user data
  - Embedded HTML/CSS as Python strings affecting maintainability

- **Minor Issues**:
  - Using `print()` instead of the `logging` module throughout the codebase
  - Long orchestration functions that could be refactored
  - Local imports within functions to avoid circular dependencies
  - Missing or incomplete docstrings in some modules
  - Missing explicit retry logic for some API calls

- **Improvement Priorities**:
  1. Address dynamic import anti-patterns
  2. Implement proper async patterns in retrieval flow
  3. Add comprehensive LangSmith tagging and sanitization
  4. Replace print statements with proper logging
  5. Refactor global state in service modules
  6. Extract HTML/CSS from Python strings

## Key Implementation Details
- **Embedding Generation**: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model with retry logic
- **Retrieval Strategy**: Semantic search with configurable number of passages (up to 300)
- **Validation Approach**: Each retrieved passage undergoes GPT-4o validation with JSON structured output
- **Parallel Processing**: Asynchronous validation of multiple passages concurrently
- **Response Generation**: GPT-4o with context limited to validated passages only
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token delivery to the UI for perceived responsiveness
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with graceful degradation

  - No exposure of sensitive information in UI
  - Input validation before API calls 

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Comprehensive try/except blocks**: Used in multiple modules to handle errors gracefully
- **Status updates**: Implemented in some modules to provide feedback to the user
- **Graceful degradation**: Implemented by reducing functionality when services fail

## Branch Enhancements (2025-05-07)
- **Code Refactoring & Architectural Improvements**:
  - **Modular Architecture**: Implemented a more modular structure by creating new packages (`components`, `css`, `i18n`, `utils`, `prompts`) and refactoring `app.py` to delegate UI and core logic to these specialized modules. This enhances maintainability and scalability.
  - **Centralized Logging**: Replaced `print` statements with a structured `logging` framework across the application for improved diagnostics and monitoring.
  - **Internationalization (i18n) Framework**: Introduced a dedicated `i18n.py` module and integrated its use, enabling easier localization and multi-language support.
  - **Decoupled Configuration & Dynamic Prompts**: Enhanced `config.py` and related services to support dynamic system prompts, reducing hardcoding and increasing flexibility in generation.
  - **Error Handling Overhaul**: Significantly improved error handling mechanisms for service initializations, API calls (e.g., OpenAI, Pinecone), and internal processing steps.
  - **Service Logic Refinement**: Refactored `services/openai_service.py` for better error management and upgraded citation extraction to an AI-based method. Enhanced `utils` with robust retry logic for embedding generation.
  - **Security Enhancements**: Introduced HTML sanitization using `bleach` via a dedicated utility in `utils/sanitization.py` to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  - **UI Componentization**: Refactored UI elements from `app.py` into discrete components (sidebar, chat, prompt gallery) for better organization and reusability.

- **System Improvements**:
  - Better standardization of code patterns across the codebase
  - Improved error resilience with more comprehensive handling
  - Enhanced security with proper HTML sanitization
  - More flexible generation capabilities with dynamic prompts
