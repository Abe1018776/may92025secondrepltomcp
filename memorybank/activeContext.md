  - ✅ FIXED: Line 171: Using `prompt` variable without initializing properly
  - Added initialization of the variable and streamlined prompt handling logic
  
- **Asyncio Error Handling**:
  - ✅ FIXED: No specific error handling for asyncio loop failures
  - Added try/except blocks for asyncio operations with user-friendly error messages
  
- **Incomplete Exception Handling**:
  - ✅ FIXED: Main RAG processing block has gaps in exception handling
  - Improved error logging and feedback for all exception cases
  
- **Security Considerations**:
  - ✅ FIXED: Multiple instances of `unsafe_allow_html=True`
  - Added bleach-based HTML sanitization for all dynamic content
  
- **Internationalization Issues**:
  - ⏳ PENDING: Hard-coded Hebrew text throughout the application
  - Makes maintenance and localization difficult
  
- **Production Code Quality**:

  - Replaced with proper logging system using Python's logging module
  
- **Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - ⏳ PENDING: Synchronous calls inside UI rendering blocks
  - Could cause UI freezing during intensive operations
  
- **Service Resilience**:
  - ⏳ PENDING: No retry mechanism for service initialization failures
  - Single point of failure for external service dependencies

## Project Summary
The project is a RAG-based application named "Divrei Yoel AI Chat" that provides Hebrew-language access to Chassidic texts, specifically works of the Satmar Rebbe. It implements a three-stage RAG pipeline (Retrieval → Validation → Generation) with Pinecone for retrieval and OpenAI's GPT-4o for validation and generation. The application has an enhanced Streamlit-based UI with improved RTL support for Hebrew text, a prompt gallery, and intelligent citation extraction.

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining issue fixes:
  1. Implement proper internationalization for Hebrew text
  2. Optimize performance by making UI rendering calls asynchronous
  3. Add retry mechanism for service initialization failures
- Address newly identified issues (see tasks.md)
- Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
- Monitor new features for user adoption and feedback
- Consider additional accessibility improvements
- Explore potential for expanding text corpus
