# Task Tracking Guidelines

## Overview
This rule provides guidelines for maintaining and updating [memorybank/tasks.md](mdc:memorybank/tasks.md) throughout the development process. The task list should be updated after each significant process step to maintain accurate project status.

## Update Requirements

### After Each Process Step
1. Update "Last Updated" date in Executive Summary
2. Adjust task counts in Executive Summary
3. Move completed tasks to appropriate sections
4. Update progress indicators (✓, [ ], [x])
5. Add any new tasks discovered during the process

### Section-Specific Updates

#### Executive Summary
- Update Project Status if phase changes
- Recalculate Pending and Completed task counts
- Update Complexity Level if assessment changes

#### Branch Achievements
- Add new achievements with ✓ prefix
- Group achievements by category
- Include specific implementation details

#### Active Development Tasks
- Update priority levels if changed
- Add new technical debt items discovered
- Update security improvements needed
- Add new UX improvement requirements
- Maintain clear issue references (e.g., RET-DYNAMIC-IMPORTS)

#### Project Notes
- Add timestamped entries for significant changes
- Update rules compliance status
- Document new issues identified
- Track implementation progress

#### Task Archive
- Move completed tasks with completion timestamps
- Maintain categorization of archived tasks
- Include brief completion notes if relevant

## Update Process

### Pre-Update Checks
1. Review current task status
2. Identify completed tasks
3. List new tasks discovered
4. Note any priority changes

### Update Steps
1. Update Executive Summary metrics
2. Add new achievements if applicable
3. Update Active Development Tasks
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Add new tasks
   - Update priorities
4. Add relevant Project Notes
5. Move completed tasks to Archive

### Post-Update Validation
1. Verify all sections are properly formatted
2. Check timestamp accuracy
3. Validate task counts match
4. Ensure proper categorization

## Format Requirements

### Task Format
```markdown
- [ ] **Task Name** (ISSUE-REFERENCE)
  - File: `filename.py` (Line XX)
  - Issue: Brief description
  - Solution: Proposed solution
```

### Achievement Format
```markdown
- ✓ Achievement description with specific details
```

### Project Note Format
```markdown
- Note description (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
```

## Automation Hooks

### Pre-Commit
- Validate task.md format
- Update task counts
- Verify timestamps

### Post-Process
- Check for completed tasks
- Update achievement list
- Recalculate metrics

## Error Prevention
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use proper timestamp format
- Keep issue references consistent
- Preserve existing categories
- Maintain proper indentation

## Best Practices
1. Update tasks.md immediately after process completion
2. Include specific file references when relevant
3. Maintain clear issue tracking references
4. Keep achievement descriptions specific and measurable
5. Use consistent formatting throughout the document
